\section*{Introduction}
Nowadays edge detection techniques have several applications. For example,  a content based video retrieval is widely required for searching digital information in large databases, in order to improve text based retrieval systems \cite{1}. It also has an important role in the development of self-driving vehicles, that need to perform a real-time feature detection \cite{2}, and in medical field, in the analysis of digital images of pathological conditions, such as tumors \cite{3}.    \\
The ultimate goal of this project is to find the main features in a video and to be able to follow their trajectories. In particular, we will analyse single video frames using edge detection, which is an image segmentation technique.  \\
There exists a great variety of clustering algorithms that can perform an efficient image segmentation, which is a fundamental step in feature extraction.  The first step consists in analysing different clustering algorithms and detect the most suitable one to the problem at hand. \\
Since the frames could be noisy or blurry, the next stage will focus on possible ways to improve the result of the clustering algorithm, by looking for an optimal sharpening operator. In this step some deblurring techniques will be examined. \\
Finally, the edge detection will be executed in parallel on each frame of the video, in order to improve the performance.

\section{Project tasks}
\subsection{Image clustering}
Clustering ia a technique that allows, given a dataset of points, to classify them into different groups depending on their features. In our case the datapoints that have to be classified are the pixels of the given image. The  algorithms that will be examined are k-means, DBSCAN and spectral clustering. 
\subsubsection{k-means}
The k-means algorithm is the simpliest and the most popular clustering algorithm. Its ultimate goal is to partition $n$ initial datapoints into $k$ clusters. It requires that the user provides the number $k$ of clusters that have to be found. The algorithms uses an iterative techniques:,starting from an initial set of random centroids. At each iteration it generates the clusters by minimizing the Euclidean distance $D$ between each point $x_i$  and  the centroids $c_j$:  
$$\arg \min\limits_{j}D(x_i, c_j)\;\;\;\; j = 1, \dots, k$$
Then, for each cluster $C_j$ a new centroid $c_j$ is computed as the mean of all $n_j$ points $x_i$ assigned to the cluster in the previous step: 
$$c_j = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{x_i \in C_j} x_i$$

\subsubsection{DBSCAN}
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm needs two parameters in order to perform clustering on data: the maximum radius (\textit{eps}) of the neighbourhood and the minimum number of points (\textit{MinPts}) in the \textit{eps}-neighbourhood of a point. All the points are classified as: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{core point}: if it has equal or more than \textit{MinPts} points in its  \textit{eps}-neighbourhood 
	\item \textbf{border point}: if it has less than \textit{MinPts} points in its  \textit{eps}-neighbourhood, but it is in the neighbourhood of a core point
	\item \textbf{noise point}: any point that is not a core or a border point.
\end{itemize} 
Then the datapoints are assigned to clusters in the following way. Any two core points that belong to each other's neighbourhood (located within a distance \textit{eps}) are assigned to the same cluster; any border point that belongs to the \textit{eps}-neighbourhood of a core point is assigned to the same cluster of the core point. Noise points are discarded.

	\label{fig:dbscan}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Spectral clustering}
The spectral clustering makes use of the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the adjacency matrix $L$ of the data, that specify all the connections between the image pixels.
The eigenvector corresponding to the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1=0$ is the vector of all ones and it does not provide information about the graph structure. The second lowest eigenvector, instead, called the ``Fiedler eigenvector,'' is used by spectral partitioning to divide into sub graphs. The pixels that correspond to a negative value in the eigenvector will be in one group and the ones corresponding to a positive value in the other. 
For this clustering algorithm, unlike the others, require the construction of the adjacency matrix of the image.

\subsection{Image deblurring}
After the selection of the clustering technique, the next step will be trying to improve the quality of the video frames to see if the algorithm works better. The video frames will be deblurred with different operators and the most suitable one will be chosen.

\subsection{Feature extraction and machine learning}


\subsection{Parallelization}
The last step consists in the parallelization of the program to improve the performance.
